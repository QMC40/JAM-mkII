1.	Problem statement
John Doe runs a local convenience store chain that currently seeks job applicants using a sign posted in a window and paper application forms. A candidate must see the sign, come into the store, and request an application.  The applicant either fills out the form on site disrupting service and distracting staff from their duties or returns it where management would then receive the form and review it.  If suitable, contact the candidate to arrange an interview potentially culminating in the hiring decision and onboarding a new employee.  An application handled by peers unsecured could easily get lost, damaged, or potentially be illegible to management.  Archaic, this system potentially exposes personal information to staff members with no need, distracts counter staff from loss prevention and serving customers, and carries a managerial burden justifying the expense of moving to a modern secure web-based solution.

2.	User Stories:
As a manager, I need to ensure we have an appropriate number of staff on shift, as well as some employees who are available for surge event situations so our business can function in a reasonable and reliable capacity.

As a job seeker, I will be applying to many locations. I find it much more accessible to use a company’s website to apply versus driving to a physical location to retrieve a paper application.  

As an owner, it is important I can view my company’s workforce information. Much of the hiring is not done by myself, so a website allows me to see staffing data.  A site can also allow private communication between managers and myself when discretion is needed.

As a manager, I can directly post job positions with better described requirements versus human resources posting positions on sites such as Indeed or Handshake with perhaps less than clear understanding of the role’s needs.  The latter is often done unintentionally but has effects on hiring and filling roles with appropriately skilled people.

3.	Requirements:
John Doe runs a local convenience store chain with 4 managers and 18 employees spread amongst 4 stores.  He expects to hire 6-9 people a year due to turnover at a minimum. Using traditional paper applications and one on one candidate interviews for each position he expects to spend about 6-10 man/hours fulfilling each vacancy. A candidate must come in a store and request an application or information about the job requiring staff to manage the first interactions deferring the first hiring role to whomever is available. By supplying a hiring interface that can screen candidates using automated testing, collect administrative data, and form the backbone of a managerial admin system for things like scheduling, payroll, and HR administration substantial benefits could be offered to small business owners.

Functional requirements:
•	Provide accessible portal for applicants to apply for employment
•	Administer minimum skills testing to applicants
•	Screen applicants with disqualifying attributes automatically
•	Maintain record of applicants and hiring / screening results
•	Automatically notify hiring manager of new applicants
•	Notify applicants of hiring decision via email also containing onboarding steps to follow
•	Provide historic data on employees and applicants allowing review of past interactions with an applicant
•	Provide a database for information required to carry out managerial tasks and local/state/federal employment record keeping and administration.
•	Notify applicant of expiration of application and all data not required or allowed to be stored for historic and managerial purposes expunged from database securely to ensure applicant privacy
•	Allow management to open or close applications as necessary 

Non-Functional requirements:
•	Comply with the ADA and local/state/federal EO and privacy requirements 
•	Remove any role in hiring from counter staff through easy direction to hiring portal via QR code on counter or building front
•	Application via secure web form reduces potential identity theft and ensures adequate privacy to the applicant
•	Streamline filling job vacancies by removing delays and possible obstructions in hiring via paper applications
•	Reduce non-productive interviews through initial screening for unsuitability

4.	Requirements Implemented during “First Iteration”:
•	Provide accessible portal for applicants to apply for employment
•	Administer minimum skills testing to applicants
