revamp of se project
Started to work on original draft of the project but couldn't make headway with it so started from scratch.  Drafted all the front end, then models, migrated Db and
started tweaking and peeking on it and tuning it, also created some seed data to work on during development, job list works and starting inputs and admin stuff
